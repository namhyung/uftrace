NAME
====
uftrace-report - Print statistics and summary for trace data


SYNOPSIS
========
uftrace report [*options*]


DESCRIPTION
===========
This command collects trace data from a given data file and prints statistics and summary information.  It shows function statistics by default, but can show threads statistics with `--threads` option and show differences to given data with `--diff` option.


OPTIONS
=======
\--threads
:   Report thread summary information rather than function statistics.

-s *KEYS*[,*KEYS*,...], \--sort=*KEYS*[,*KEYS*,...]
:   Sort functions by given KEYS.  Multiple KEYS can be given, separated by comma (,).  Possible keys are 'total' (time), 'self' (time), 'call', 'avg', 'min', 'max'.  Note that first 3 keys should be used when neither of '--avg-total' nor '--avg-self' is used.  Likewise, the last 3 keys should be used when either of those option is used.

\--avg-total
:   Show average, min, max of each functions total time.

\--avg-self
:   Show average, min, max of each functions self time.

\--diff=*DATA*
:   Report difference between the input trace data and the given DATA.

\--sort-column=*IDX*
:   When --diff option is used, 3 columns will be shown for each total time, self time and call count.  This is option is to select the index of column to be used as a sort key.  The index 0 is for original data given by --file option, and index 1 is for data given by --diff option, and index 2 is for (percentage of) difference between the two data.

-k, \--kernel
:   Trace kernel functions as well as user functions.  Only kernel functions inside user functions will be shown.

--kernel-full
:   Show all kernel functions called outside of user functions.  Implies \--kernel option.

-F *FUNC*, \--filter=*FUNC*
:   Set filter to trace selected functions only.  This option can be used more than once.  See `uftrace-replay` for filters.

-N *FUNC*, \--notrace=*FUNC*
:   Set filter not to trace selected functions (and their children).  This option can be used more than once.  See `uftrace-replay` for filters.

-T *TRG*, \--trigger=*TRG*
:   Set trigger on selected functions.  This option can be used more than once.  See `uftrace-replay` for triggers.

-t *TIME*, \--time-filter=*TIME*
:   Do not show small functions under the time threshold.  If some functions explicitly have 'trace' trigger, those are always traced regardless of execution time.

\--tid=*TID*[,*TID*,...]
:   Only print functions from given threads.  To see the list of threads in the data file, you can use `uftrace-report --threads` or `uftrace-info` command.

-D *DEPTH*, \--depth *DEPTH*
:   Set trace limit in nesting level.
