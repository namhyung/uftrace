NAME
====
uftrace-report - Print statistics and summary for trace data


SYNOPSIS
========
uftrace report [*options*]


DESCRIPTION
===========
This command collects trace data from a given data file and prints statistics and summary information.  It shows function statistics by default, but can show thread statistics with the `--threads` option and show differences between traces with the `--diff` option.


OPTIONS
=======
\--threads
:   Report thread summary information rather than function statistics.

-s *KEYS*[,*KEYS*,...], \--sort=*KEYS*[,*KEYS*,...]
:   Sort functions by given KEYS.  Multiple KEYS can be given, separated by comma (,).  Possible keys are `total` (time), `self` (time), `call`, `avg`, `min`, `max`.  Note that the first 3 keys should be used when neither of `--avg-total` nor `--avg-self` is used.  Likewise, the last 3 keys should be used when either of those options is used.

\--avg-total
:   Show average, min, max of each function's total time.

\--avg-self
:   Show average, min, max of each function's self time.

\--diff=*DATA*
:   Report differences between the input trace data and the given DATA.

\--sort-column=*IDX*
:   When `--diff` is used, 3 columns will be shown: total time, self time and call count.  This option selects the index of the column to be used as a sort key.  Index 0 is for original data given by the `--data` option, index 1 is for data given by the `--diff` option, and index 2 is for (percentage) differences between the two data.

-k, \--kernel
:   Show kernel functions as well as user functions.  Only kernel functions called inside user functions will be shown.

--kernel-full
:   Show all kernel functions, including those called outside of user functions.

\--kernel-only
:   Show kernel functions only without user functions.  Implies `--kernel`.

-F *FUNC*, \--filter=*FUNC*
:   Set filter to trace selected functions only.  This option can be used more than once.  See `uftrace-replay`(1) for an explanation of filters.

-N *FUNC*, \--notrace=*FUNC*
:   Set filter not to trace selected functions (or the functions called underneath them).  This option can be used more than once.  See `uftrace-replay`(1) for an explanation of filters.

-T *TRG*, \--trigger=*TRG*
:   Set trigger on selected functions.  This option can be used more than once.  See `uftrace-replay`(1) for an explanation of triggers.

-t *TIME*, \--time-filter=*TIME*
:   Do not account functions which run under the time threshold.  If some functions explicitly have the 'trace' trigger applied, those are always accounted regardless of execution time.

\--tid=*TID*[,*TID*,...]
:   Only print functions called by the given threads.  To see the list of threads in the data file, you can use `uftrace report --threads` or `uftrace info`.  This option can also be used more than once.

-D *DEPTH*, \--depth *DEPTH*
:   Set trace limit in nesting level.

-r *RANGE*, \--time-range=*RANGE*
:   Only show functions executed within the time RANGE.  The RANGE can be \<start\>~\<stop\> (separated by "~") and one of \<start\> and \<stop\> can be omitted.  The \<start\> and \<stop\> are timestamp or elapsed time if they have \<time_unit\> postfix, for example '100us'.  The timestamp or elapsed time can be shown with `-f time` or `-f elapsed` option respectively in `uftrace replay`(1).

In the above example, the result was sorted by percentage of difference of self times.
