NAME
====
uftrace-report - Print statistics and summary for trace data


SYNOPSIS
========
uftrace report [*options*]


DESCRIPTION
===========
This command collects trace data from a given data file and prints statistics
and summary information.  It shows function statistics by default, but can show
task statistics with the `--task` option and show differences between traces
with the `--diff` option.


REPORT OPTIONS
==============
-s *KEYS*[,*KEYS*,...], \--sort=*KEYS*[,*KEYS*,...]
:   Sort functions by given KEYS.  Multiple KEYS can be given, separated by
    comma (,).  Possible keys are `total` (time), `self` (time), `call`, `func`,
    `avg`, `min`, `max`.  Note that the first 3 keys should be used when
    neither of `--avg-total` nor `--avg-self` is used.  Likewise, the last 3
    keys should be used when either of those options is used.

\--avg-total
:   Show average, min, max of each function's total time.

\--avg-self
:   Show average, min, max of each function's self time.

\--task
:   Report task summary information rather than function statistics.

\--diff=*DATA*
:   Report differences between the input trace data and the given DATA.

\--diff-policy=*POLICY*
:   Apply custom diff policy.  Available values are: "abs", "no-abs", "percent",
    "no-percent", "compact" and "full".  The "abs" is to sort diff result using
    absolute value so positive and negative entries can be shown together while
    "no-abs" will show positive entries first and then negative ones.  The
    "percent" is to show diff in percentage while "no-percent" is to show the
    values.  The "full" is to show all three columns of baseline, new data and
    difference while "compact" only shows the difference.  The default is "abs",
    "compact" and "no-percent".

\--sort-column=*IDX*
:   When `--diff` is used with "full" policy, 3 columns will be shown for each
    total time, self time and call count.  This option selects the index of the
    column to be used as a sort key.  Index 0 is for original data given by the
    `--data` option, index 1 is for data given by the `--diff` option, and index
    2 is for (percentage) differences between the two data.


COMMON OPTIONS
==============
-F *FUNC*, \--filter=*FUNC*
:   Set filter to trace selected functions only.  This option can be used more
    than once.  See `uftrace-replay`(1) for an explanation of filters.

-N *FUNC*, \--notrace=*FUNC*
:   Set filter not to trace selected functions (or the functions called
    underneath them).  This option can be used more than once.  See
    `uftrace-replay`(1) for an explanation of filters.

-C *FUNC*, \--caller-filter=*FUNC*
:   Set filter to trace callers of selected functions only.  This option can be
    used more than once.  See `uftrace-replay`(1) for an explanation of filters.

-T *TRG*, \--trigger=*TRG*
:   Set trigger on selected functions.  This option can be used more than once.
    See `uftrace-replay`(1) for an explanation of triggers.

-D *DEPTH*, \--depth *DEPTH*
:   Set trace limit in nesting level.

-t *TIME*, \--time-filter=*TIME*
:   Do not account functions which run under the time threshold.  If some
    functions explicitly have the 'trace' trigger applied, those are always
    accounted regardless of execution time.

\--no-libcall
:   Do not show library calls.

\--no-event
:   Do not show any events.

\--match=*TYPE*
:   Use pattern match using TYPE.  Possible types are `regex` and `glob`.
    Default is `regex`.


COMMON ANALYSIS OPTIONS
=======================
\--kernel-full
:   Show all kernel functions, including those called outside of user functions.

\--kernel-only
:   Show kernel functions only without user functions.

\--event-full
:   Show all (user) events outside of user functions.

\--tid=*TID*[,*TID*,...]
:   Only print functions called by the given tasks.  To see the list of
    tasks in the data file, you can use `uftrace report --task` or
    `uftrace info`.  This option can also be used more than once.

\--demangle=*TYPE*
:   Use demangled C++ symbol names for filters, triggers, arguments and/or
    return values.  Possible values are "full", "simple" and "no".  Default
    is "simple" which ignores function arguments and template parameters.

-r *RANGE*, \--time-range=*RANGE*
:   Only show functions executed within the time RANGE.  The RANGE can be
    \<start\>~\<stop\> (separated by "~") and one of \<start\> and \<stop\> can
    be omitted.  The \<start\> and \<stop\> are timestamp or elapsed time if
    they have \<time_unit\> postfix, for example '100us'.  The timestamp or
    elapsed time can be shown with `-f time` or `-f elapsed` option respectively
    in `uftrace replay`(1).


EXAMPLE
=======
This command shows information like the following:

    $ uftrace record abc
    $ uftrace report
      Total time   Self time       Calls  Function
      ==========  ==========  ==========  ====================
      150.829 us  150.829 us           1  __cxa_atexit

       26.046 us    0.939 us           1  a
       25.107 us    0.934 us           1  b
       24.173 us    1.715 us           1  c
       22.458 us   22.458 us           1  getpid

    $ uftrace report -s call,self
      Total time   Self time       Calls  Function
      ==========  ==========  ==========  ====================
      150.829 us  150.829 us           1  __cxa_atexit
       22.458 us   22.458 us           1  getpid
       24.173 us    1.715 us           1  c
       27.289 us    1.243 us           1  main
       26.046 us    0.939 us           1  a
       25.107 us    0.934 us           1  b

    $ uftrace report --avg-self
        Avg self    Min self    Max self  Function
      ==========  ==========  ==========  ====================
      150.829 us  150.829 us  150.829 us  __cxa_atexit
       22.458 us   22.458 us   22.458 us  getpid
        1.715 us    1.715 us    1.715 us  c
        1.243 us    1.243 us    1.243 us  main
        0.939 us    0.939 us    0.939 us  a
        0.934 us    0.934 us    0.934 us  b

    $ uftrace report --task
      Total time   Self time   Num funcs     TID  Task name
      ==========  ==========  ==========  ======  ================
       22.178 us   22.178 us           7   29955  t-abc

To see a difference between two data:

    $ uftrace record abc

    $ uftrace report --diff uftrace.data.old
    #
    # uftrace diff
    #  [0] base: uftrace.data       (from uftrace record abc )
    #  [1] diff: uftrace.data.old   (from uftrace record abc )
    #
      Total time   Self time       Calls  Function
      ==========  ==========  ==========  ====================
       -0.301 us   -0.038 us          +0  main
       -0.263 us   -0.070 us          +0  a
       -0.193 us   -0.042 us          +0  b
       -0.151 us   -0.090 us          +0  c
       -0.131 us   -0.131 us          +0  __cxa_atexit
       -0.061 us   -0.061 us          +0  getpid

The above example shows difference sorted by absolute value of total time.
The following changes it to use (non-absolute) value of self time.

    $ uftrace report --diff uftrace.data.old -s self --diff-policy no-abs
    #
    # uftrace diff
    #  [0] base: uftrace.data       (from uftrace record abc )
    #  [1] diff: uftrace.data.old   (from uftrace record abc )
    #
      Total time   Self time       Calls  Function
      ==========  ==========  ==========  ====================
       -0.301 us   -0.038 us          +0  main
       -0.193 us   -0.042 us          +0  b
       -0.061 us   -0.061 us          +0  getpid
       -0.263 us   -0.070 us          +0  a
       -0.151 us   -0.090 us          +0  c
       -0.131 us   -0.131 us          +0  __cxa_atexit

By using "full" policy, user can see raw data as well like below.
Also it's possible to sort by different column (for raw data).
The example below will sort output by total time of the base data.

    $ uftrace report --diff uftrace.data.old --sort-column 0 --diff-policy full,percent
    #
    # uftrace diff
    #  [0] base: uftrace.data       (from uftrace record abc )
    #  [1] diff: uftrace.data.old   (from uftrace record abc )
    #
                     Total time (diff)                   Self time (diff)                  Nr. called (diff)   Function
      ================================   ================================   ================================   ====================
        2.812 us    2.511 us   -10.70%     0.403 us    0.365 us    -9.43%            1          1         +0   main
        2.409 us    2.146 us   -10.92%     0.342 us    0.272 us   -20.47%            1          1         +0   a
        2.067 us    1.874 us    -9.34%     0.410 us    0.368 us   -10.24%            1          1         +0   b
        1.657 us    1.506 us    -9.11%     0.890 us    0.800 us   -10.11%            1          1         +0   c
