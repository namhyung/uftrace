NAME
====
uftrace-recv - Receive tracing data from socket and save it to files


SYNOPSIS
========
uftrace recv [*options*]


DESCRIPTION
===========
This command receives tracing data from the network and saves it to files.
Data will be sent using `uftrace-record` with -H/\--host option.

-d *DATA*, \--data=*DATA*
:   Specify directory name to save received data.

\--port=*PORT*
:   Use given port instead of the default (8090).

--run-cmd=*COMMAND*
:   Run given (shell) command as soon as receive data.  For example, one can run "uftrace replay" for received data.


EXAMPLE
=======
 The uftrace recv command should be run before sending data by record command.

    # HOST 
    $ uftrace recv -d recv_data --port 1234

 Above command starts a server with port by given (default `8090`) to receive data from remote client. 

    # CLIENT :
    $ uftrace record -H localhost -d example_data --port 1234 example

 Above command sends the trace data to a remote server that pointed by given -H option (`localhost` in this case) after running the example program.  And as you see, you can choose save directory by using `-d` option (sending data will save to `example_data` in this case).

    # HOST : Check received data
    $ uftrace replay -d recv_data/example_data
    # DURATION    TID     FUNCTION
                [17308] | main() {
                [17308] |   a() {
                [17308] |     b() {
                [17308] |       c() {
       1.058 us [17308] |         getpid();
       4.356 us [17308] |       } /* c */
       4.664 us [17308] |     } /* b */
       4.845 us [17308] |   } /* a */
       5.076 us [17308] | } /* main */

 You can find saved trace data of example from `recv_data`'s subdirectory `example_data`.  Obviously, you should check at `HOST`.
