 DYNAMIC TRACING
 ===============
-The uftrace tool supports dynamic function tracing which can be enabled at runtime (load-time, to be precise) on x86_64.  Before recording functions, normally you need to build the target program with `-pg` (or `-finstrument-functions`), then it has some performance impact because all funtions call `mcount()`.
+The uftrace tool supports dynamic function tracing which can be enabled at runtime (load-time, to be precise) on x86_64.  Before recording functions, normally you need to build the target program with `-pg` (or `-finstrument-functions`), then it has some performance impact because all functions call `mcount()`.
 
 With dynamic tracing, you can trace specific functions only given by the `-P`/`--patch` option.  However you need to add some more compiler (gcc) options when building the target program.  The gcc 5.1 or more recent versions provide `-mfentry` and `-mnop-mcount` options which add instrumentation code (i.e. calling `mcount()` function) at the very beginning of a function and convert the instruction to a NOP.  Then it has almost zero performance overhead when running in a normal condition.  The uftrace can convert it back to call `mcount()` if users want to (using `-P` option).
 
-The following example shows a error message when normally running uftrace with the excutable built with `-pg -mfentry -mnop-mcount`. Because the binary doesn't call any instrumentation code (i.e. 'mcount').
