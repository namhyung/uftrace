    - kernel tracepoint
    - scheduler (using perf syscall)
  list available events using --list-event option
  new read trigger also creates 'proc/statm' and 'page-fault' events

* libcall tracing update:
  fix to trace already resolved functions too
  trace nested calls from other libraries using --nest-libcall option
  handle BIND-NOW + PIE properly

* python scripting support:
  add new 'script' command with -S/--script option
  also support record-time scripting
  support additional filter for script execution
  allow to specify options for recording

* report diff change:
  sort by (absolute) diff
  add --diff-policy option to control behavior
  add 'func' sort key
  change color setting

* other changes:
  std::string argument display
  add elapsed time info
  "uftrace recv --run-cmd" can execute user-given command
  add "finish" trigger action to tracing
  add --opt-file option to allow reading options from file
  add --keep-pid option to preserve pid when running program

uftrace v0.7
============
* dynamic tracing support (x86_64 only)
  enable tracing for selected functions with -P option
  it needs some compiler support though
  - gcc with -mnop-mcount option
  - clang (X-ray) with -fxray-instrument option

* AArch64 support
  add preliminary support for ARM v8 (64-bit)
  first integer argument is missing

* kernel tracing change
  show recorded kernel functions by default
  partial support for event tracing
  fix to send/receive kernel data via network
  filter out sys_clock_gettime() for non-VDSO systems

* dump change:
  show arguments and return values properly
  show more kernel tracing info
  fix file offset printing

* build change:
  fix various problems on GCC 7
  update configure script for better distro packaging

And many bug fixes and improvements.  Thanks for all contributors:
  Dridi Boukelmoune, Honggyu Kim, Taeung Song, Wonseok Ko


uftrace v0.6.2
--------------
* dlopen() support:
  can show functions from dynamic loaded library using dlopen()

* kernel tracing update:
  save kernel metadata so that it can be viewed from a different machine
  adjust tracer settings to reduce lost kernel data

* filter change:
  remove '+' sign in elapsed time for --time-range option
  allow to use 'm' or 'min' to specify elapsed time

And many bug fixes and improvements.  Thanks for all contributors:
  Abder Benbachir, Geneviève Bastien, Honggyu Kim, Taeung Song,

  The --kernel-skip-out is deprecated and use
  The --kernel-full is to show kernel functions outside of user functions
  The --kernel-only option was added

* replay change:
  add --output-fields option to customize the info on the left side
  currently time, delta, elapsed, duration, tid and addr fields are supported

* filter change:
  apply time filter on replay
  add --time-range option to limit data analysis
  report, graph and dump honors same filter on replay
  add 'time' trigger to set a different threshold on specific functions

* flame-graph support:
  "uftrace dump --flame-graph" creates a SVG file
  use --sample-time option to control sampling frequency in the output

* build change:
  improve build process to facilitate distro packaging
  configure script checks dependency and shows warning


uftrace v0.6
============
* project open!
